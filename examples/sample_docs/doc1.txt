Rust Programming Language
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling â€” an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.
